# ClassicSonicCompatibilityMod
A slight level mod to allow Classic Sonic to fully traverse Modern Sonic's Act 2 stages.

- Green Hill Zone Act 2 (https://youtu.be/lM5sJdTubNM)
- Chemical Plant Act 2 (https://youtu.be/5XbWXDFgGB8)
- Sky Sanctuary Act 2 (https://youtu.be/1n_E0HG7ZRg)
- Speed Highway (https://youtu.be/_0IDJ-jdsoQ)
- City Escape (https://youtu.be/K31_5Zfglh0)
- Seaside Hill (not edited yet)
- Crisis City (not edited yet)
- Rooftop Run (not edited yet)
- Planet Wisp (not likely, crashes upon load)

Planet Wisp likely crashes when trying to initialize the Rocket Wisp for Classic Sonic, no amount of level editing would allow him to play the stage.

Modern Sonic's bosses and rival battles are likely not beatable as Classic Sonic (with the exception of Perfect Chaos).
- Shadow: Black screen upon level load, unbeatable.
- Perfect Chaos: Beatable as-is, can be edited to replace rainbow rings and trick launch pads.
- Silver: Classic Sonic is too slow to get attacks in, even with Super Sonic or the homing attack.
- Egg Dragoon: Classic Sonic is too slow to get attacks in, and the game crashes when skydiving.
